Installation
  sudo apt install -y tmux

  almost every command starts from ctrl-b, that's the essential
  I guess, it is to show respect to the great key of ctrl-c
  and it is just before the order of c

start tmux
  tmux
panes
  create a new pane
    create a new vertical pane
      ctrl-b %
        first press ctrl-b, then press %, that is: shift-5
    create a new horizontal pane
      first-b "
        first press ctrl-b, then press ", that is: shift-'
  move between pane
    ctrl-b left, right, up, down
      first press ctrl-b, then press left, right, up, down
      and this time you will see the cursor changes
  change pane size
    ctrl-b alt-up, down, left, right
      if you dont release the alt- key you can move multiple times
      this feature cames from tmux 1.8
windows
  create a new window
    ctrl-b c
      from the bottom you will see the named window
  statusbar
    [0] 0:zsh  1:zsh- 2:zsh*
      * means currently we are in 2nd window (zsh)
      - stands for previous window
  switch between windows
    ctrl-b N
      use N to denote the window N
  rename a window
    ctrl-b ,
  popup
    tmux popup
      create a temp popup window, in the top-front
      you can only work in this top-front
sessions
  (IMPORTANT) This is why tmus *shines*!
  preserve your session, if a connection drops/ is lost

  create a session
    tmux new -s docker
  list session(s)
    tmux ls
      0: 3 windows (created Sat Sep 11 17:23:07 2021)
  rename session
    tmux rename-session -t 0 git
  attach to
    tmux attach -t 0
      The exact states are preserved, including what's on the screen previously
      These session will be preserved, until the system reboot!!!
  detach from
    ctrl-b d
      *back* to the normal shell
      also displayed: [detached (from session 0)]
      we you runs ps -ef, you can still see 
      these processes are running in the background
  kill
    tmux kill-session -t docker
  choose-tree
    tmux choose-tree
      you can only run inside a tmux session
      and then you will be able to choose session/panes/windows
mouse mode
  tmux set -g mouse on
    right click menu
    use mouse to resize panes
